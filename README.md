# Angular Demo on using Services

## To get set up:
- Make sure you have Angular CLI, npm, and git installed
- Pull the code into a directory using `git pull `
- install the necessary packages using `npm install`
- run `ng serve` and visit `http://localhost:4200/` to visit the app :) 

# Tips on using Angular CLI 

## Development server (local)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
